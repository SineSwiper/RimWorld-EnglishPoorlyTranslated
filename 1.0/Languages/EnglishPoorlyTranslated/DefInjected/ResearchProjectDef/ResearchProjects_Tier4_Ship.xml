  <!-- EN: Escaping from this planet - it would be freedom at last, and maybe a return home.\n\nBut also incredibly dangerous.\n\nMany desperate souls want off this planet. Ship reactors take 15 days to charge up. Once you begin that process, the ship reactor will emit an energy signature detectable from thousands of kilometers away. Raiders will flock to attack you in waves, with an intensity you've never seen. Mechanoids are also known to be attracted to such energy signatures for their own mysterious reasons.\n\nIt won't start until you activate your ship's reactor, but when it does, it'll be ferocious. You'll need to stockpile resources, weapons, and defenses for the onslaught if you hope to escape alive. -->

You can start this process still shone with a unique energy signature, which can scale to thousands of kilometers away from the reactor if needed. Pirates will attack you waves of unprecedented strength. Also metshanoids is known to be attracted to these signs. What the? There is a mystery.\n\nAttacks wanted only the beginning of the reactor, but when they start, it will be very difficult. We hope that the attack and escape this will be for a total of cooked food, weapons and protection vobereiten.</ShipBasics.discoveredLetterText>
