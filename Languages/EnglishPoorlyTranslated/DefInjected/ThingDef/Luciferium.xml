  <!-- EN: A concoction of mechanites that dramatically improve the body's functioning in all respects. Over time, it can even heal old scarred-over wounds or brain damage, though it cannot regenerate lost limbs.

Many have been forced to kill friends when no more of the seductive red pills could be found. -->
